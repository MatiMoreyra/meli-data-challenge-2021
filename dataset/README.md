# Dataset directory
Download the dataset files from https://ml-challenge.mercadolibre.com/downloads and put them into this directory.

On linux, you can do that by running:
```
wget \
https://meli-data-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/test_data.csv \
https://meli-data-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/train_data.parquet \
https://meli-data-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/items_static_metadata_full.jl
```
